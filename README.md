<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
Most water-saving schemes are commonplace in today's world, making the message ineffective and easy to gloss over. We plan to offer users a customised shower experience to inspire them to save water, rather than to impose the solution upon them.

<h3>Our Solution</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A simple attachment that can be connected with any showerhead. This attachment communicates with an app that will help users keep track of their water usage in showers.
</li>
  <li> Best implemented at a university-wide level, where we can gamify the entire process by providing options for the users to compete against each other.
</li>
  <li>Redefining the way messages on environmental action are delivered.
</li>
</ul>

<p> Our platform works by simply reading the amount of water passed through a flow rate sensor connected to an Arduino module, and presenting this data in fun and intuitive ways </p>

<p>Here are screenshots from the website that we created as a means to communicate our message and provide basic functionality. This functionality was later removed from the website as we converted our application from a web based platform to an android and iOS application, which you can check out <a href="https://github.com/malhaar2002/h2know-flutter">here</a>.
